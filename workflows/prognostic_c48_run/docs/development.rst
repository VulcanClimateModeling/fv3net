Developer's Guide
-----------------

The prognostic run is developed via docker and docker-compose. This
environment is based off the `prognostic_run` docker image, but has
bind-mounts to the packages in "/external" of this repository and this
directory, which allows locally developing this workflow and its
dependencies.

It is usually fastest to use the latest docker image from Google Container
Repository. Pull the image::

    docker pull us.gcr.io/vcm-ml/prognostic_run:latest

.. note::

    If you run into problems, it would be best to rebuild the docker image from scratch::

        docker-compose build fv3

Enter a bash shell in the image::

    docker-compose run fv3net bash

.. note ::

    This docker-compose will propagate key-based authentication to Google
    Cloud Platform into the docker image. It expects that environmental variable
    ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` points to a json key. See Google's
    `documentation <https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys>`_
    on how to generate one.

Run the tests::

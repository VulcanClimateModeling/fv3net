## Prognostic run reports

Compute summary diagnostics and metrics from the output of a prognostic run and
visualize on report comparing multiple runs.

See the [Sphinx
Documentation](https://vulcanclimatemodeling.com/docs/diagnostics/)
for more details.

An argo workflow to compute the diagnostics and make the report is available and
its usage is described at [`fv3net/workflow/argo/README.md`](https://github.com/VulcanClimateModeling/fv3net/blob/master/workflows/argo/README.md).

History

latest
------
* Updated fv3gfs-python to v0.4.1. As part of this, refactored sklearn_interface functions from runtime to the prognostic run runfile.

* Prognostic run report: compute and plot scalar metrics, generate report via
  python script, change output location (#226)
* Multithreaded uploading in one-step jobs (#260)
* Made nudging run upload more robust using k8s yaml templating submission and gsutil container upload

0.2.0 (2020-04-23)
------------------
* Added physics on end_to_end workflow configuration yaml. Only does baseline run for now.
* Added integration tests (tests/end_to_end_integration) that through CircleCI after image builds
* Fixed integration tests to use same version tags of the `fv3net` and `prognostic_run` images
* Added makefile targets to submit integration tests to cluster from local machine and to get docker image names
* Made simple step output directory names the default in the orchestrator
* Add `run_with_learned_nudging` workflow
* Update fv3config submodule to v0.3.1
* Add `get_config()` function to fv3net.runtime
* Change API of `diagnostics_to_zarr` workflow so that it saves output zarrs in the given run directory
* Add `nudge_to_obs` module to `kube_jobs`, which helps with the configuration of FV3GFS model runs that are nudged towards GFS analysis
* Add public function: vcm.convert_timestamps
* Add pipeline to load C384 restart data into a zarr
* One step run workflow outputs a single zarr as output (instead of individual directories for each timestep), downstream workflows are adjusted to use this data format
* Train data pipeline and offline diagnostics workflow read in variable names information from yaml provided to python
* Force load data in diagnostics workflow before compute and plot
* Improved logging when running FV3 model
* HTML reports now have title and timestamp, and optionally can include a dict of metadata as a table
* `test_sklearn_model` and `train_sklearn_model` workflows save a yaml of all the timesteps for each respective step
* `train_sklearn_model` now creates an html report of its own, which includes ML model metadata and a plot of temporal distribution of training data
* offline ML report generated by `test_sklearn_model` has new plot of temporal distribution of testing data
* new external package `report` created, which handles generation of workflow reports
* new external package `gallery` created, which generates figures which can be used by multiple workflows
* add __main__.py to fv3net/regression/sklearn in order to better separate model training from I/O and report generation
* Build `prognostic_run` image from v0.3.5 of `fv3gfs-python`
* Adjust diagnostic outputs for prognostic run with name net_moistening instead of net_precip and add total_precipitation to outputs
* final adjustments and fixes for advisory council results



0.1.1 (2020-03-25)
------------------
* Updates to make end-to-end workflow work with fv3atm (fv3gfs-python:v0.3.1)
* Added bump2version for automated versioning of `fv3net` resources
* Add CircleCI build/push capabilities for `fv3net` images


0.1.0 (2020-03-20)
------------------
* First release of fv3net

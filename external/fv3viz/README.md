`fv3viz`
========

This package contains visualization tools used by the Allen Institute for AI Climate Modeling ML team. The package includes three types of functions:
    1. those associated with plotting cubed-sphere tile data as maps using cartopy
    2. common diagnostic plots, and
    3. histograms of set of timesteps useful for describing ML datasets

To get started, see example images and cubed-sphere plotting routines provided in the image gallery.

Note: The default behavior of fv3viz is to redirect external downloads of shapefiles to an internally hosted repo which contains only the global-scale coastlines file. If other files are desired, please set the following environment variable prior to importing fv3viz to use cartopy's source:

```bash
$ export CARTOPY_EXTERNAL_DOWNLOADER="natural_earth"
```

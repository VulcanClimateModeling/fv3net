This package contains visualization tools used by the Vulcan Climate Modeling ML team. The package includes three types of
functions: 1) those associated with plotting cubed-sphere tile data as maps using cartopy, 2) common diagnostic plots, and 3)
histograms of set of timesteps useful for describing ML datasets.

To get started, see example images and cubed-sphere plotting routines provided in the image gallery.

Installation
============

Currently the only way to install vcm is from the source.  Start by cloning the
fv3net repository and navigating to the vcm subdirectory.  Then use pip to
install the package:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/VulcanClimateModeling/fv3net.git
    $ cd fv3net/external/vcm
    $ pip install .
